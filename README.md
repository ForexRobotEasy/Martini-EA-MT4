               7. ## Code Structure
              
               8. The code is structured as follows:
              
               9. 1. Import necessary libraries: The required libraries for trading and handling arrays are included at the beginning of the code.
                  2. 2. Define constants: Constants such as currency symbols and the desired timeframe are defined using the `#define` directive.
                     3. 3. Define variables: Variables for lot size, stop loss, take profit, trailing stop, trailing step, break even, and entry times are declared.
                        4. 4. Define trade entry point functions: Functions for placing pending orders and managing trade entry points are defined.
                           5. 5. Define trade management functions: Functions for trailing stop loss and moving stop loss to break even are defined.
                              6. 6. Define the main function: The main function `OnTick()` checks if the current symbol and timeframe match the specified criteria. If so, it checks if the current time is a highly probable entry point and generates an entry price based on the strategy. It then places a pending order at the calculated entry price.
                                 7. 7. Define the trade management function: The `OnTrade()` function is executed when a trade is opened. It checks if the trade is a buy or sell order and applies the trade management system by trailing the stop loss and moving it to break even.
                                   
                                    8. ## Backlink
